				answer: "Perfect! Start with beginner workshops (⭐). They're designed for people with zero experience. You'll learn by building real projects, not watching tutorials." 
			},
			{ 
				question: "How much time does it take each week?", 
				answer: "Most workshops take 2-5 hours to complete. You can spread that across the week however works for you. Ship at least one project per week to stay on track." 
			},
			{ 
				question: "What counts as 'shipping'?", 
				answer: "Shipping means finishing something and sharing it. A working demo, a live website, a GitHub repo — something real that exists in the world, not just on your laptop." 
			},
			{ 
				question: "Can I do my own project instead?", 
				answer: "Yes! You can follow workshops or build your own thing. The only rule is you ship something every week. Mix and match however you want." 
			},
			{ 
				question: "What are the prizes?", 
				answer: "Complete workshops to earn points. More ships = more prizes. We'll announce specific prizes before the program starts. Think stickers, hardware, and bragging rights."
